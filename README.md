# Truffle Experiment

Truffle is an experiment in (application) embedding scripting languages that offer high performance, ease of embedding, lightweight requirements (no dependencies by default and low compile times), and a familiar syntax.

The experiment offers the follow optional features:
* **reedline** - a readline-like interactive line editor
* **cranelift** - an efficient JIT engine
